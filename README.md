# Supermarket-Management-System

The task was to build a management system for a convenience store in Carleton, where the managers would be able to manage stock, volunteers, and the main schedule. 

We finished the management of the stock and volunteers, and data visualization of the popularity of the stock. 

We used the MEAN stack to build this which allowed us to get a quick start. We followed an MVC architecture to allow us to concurrently the application.
